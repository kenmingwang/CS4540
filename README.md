## BootStrap Components

- Buttons
- Table
- Collapsable
- Drop down menu
- Badge

## UI/UX

- As said in previous README, I migrated my tables to a collapsable so that one single page can contain more information, and it's cleaner to  see.
- Improved the layout of the page, contents will be in the middle in all resolutions. 
- Followed the CIS design so it fits more into the U system.
